So we are basically civil engineering students blessed with a good
computer science background. With pySA, we aim to make learning process
more easy and efficient. We want a pySA to be a study bible for structural
analysis and we need your help! Anyone interested can contribute and help
us in our project to make pySA, a better educational tool. Feel free to
post your suggestions by creating an issue at
